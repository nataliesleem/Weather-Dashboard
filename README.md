This application allows users to search for a city to see the weather. Upon search, the user is presented with the current day's weather (Date, Tempterature, Wind, Humidity, and UVI) as well as a 5-day forecast for that city. The UVI is color coded to indicate whether it is low, moderate, or high. Additionally, each user's search is saved onto the search bar so they can easily access previous searches.
